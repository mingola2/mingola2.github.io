This is my personal portfolio website. It is a 3 page website, which is navigable via a nav bar on the right side of the screen. 
The nav bar has a hover color effect to reinforce which section you are about to select. The three pages are the home screen, work 
page, and about me. The work page showcases 4 projects, and includes a short description of each. The about me page showcases a 
personal photo and a paragraph about myself and my studies. Also on the about me page is a spotify widget to my spotify playlist 
and a link to my resume vias a word link in the paragraph. The link opens a separate tab with my resume.
